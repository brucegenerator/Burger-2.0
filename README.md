# What it is

Burger-2.0 is a dynamic burger building application built in React with custom CSS for the burger ingredients.

As a user clicks ingredients to add, the burger is built dynamically in the view.

Users can "order" the burger, similar to real online ordering apps, which saves it to firebase.

# Future

The project is far from complete but has some cool features.

Future updates will include state management conversion to redux for handling various global states, such as user accounts, as the application becomes more complex.
